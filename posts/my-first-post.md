Today I'm adding the blog section of my portfolio. Although originally a part of the launch, I decided to postpone it in the end in favor of a better, slightly more challenging implementation.<br><br>

But first things first. Let's talk about the thought process and technical decisions made to bring this project to life.<br><br>

**<h1 style="font-size: 24px">Idea</h1>**<br>

Having worked with Next.js on my first internship I fell in love with it. Although I may have only scratched the surface of its possibilities, the documentation and general structure of the framework made it really exciting and fun to learn and work with. <br>
I needed a portfolio and wanted to use it again, this time on a personal project. The math could not be easier.<br><br>

**<h1 style="font-size: 24px">Setting Up</h1>**<br>

First I created the project via **npx create-next-app@latest** and then opted to select technologies such as:<br><br> 1. **React 19** and **TypeScript**: Better, more versatile development experience<br> 2. **TailwindCSS**: Rapid styling and comfort<br> 3. **ESLint**: Syntax control and additional debugging aid<br> 4. **shadcn/ui**: High-quality, versatile UI components.<br><br>

Additionally I opted for **Zod** for great and optimisation friendly e-mail management, and **Tailwind Intersect** for smooth animations across my page.<br><br>
 
All of these technologies and tools allowed me to work in a comfortable environment that made it easy to work on my portfolio and plan out my future content.<br><br>

**<h1 style="font-size: 24px">Planned Features</h1>**<br>

This very **Blog** post you're reading is one of them. Amongst my plans are **Accessibility** to work with WCAG regulations regarding keyboard navigation and screen reader cooperation, as well as **Internationalization** to support multiple languages (English/Swedish).
